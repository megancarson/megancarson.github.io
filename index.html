    <p id="intro">As a lower sixth student, I study physics, economics, double maths and software systems development. Unfortunately,
        three of these subjects don't require coursework and don't provide opportunities for any projects, so I've only managed to concoct
        up enough material for one page.</p>
    <div id="head">
      <h1>Event-Driven Programming</h1>
      <p>This constitutes 50% of my AS grade and 20% of my A-Level. It involves creating a game or quiz and writing up an extensive portfolio
          about the development process. I've spent the best part of four months working on this project, and I think I'm going to be working 
          on it well into the forseeable future too - up until the last minute of my ever-imminent deadline.</p>

    <div id="first">
      <h2>The Program</h2>
      <p>I decided to create an economics-based quiz using C# Windows Forms. The game writes to binary and text files and uses serialisation,
          as well as using text input, buttons, radio buttons and drag-and-drop labels. The system is worth 22 marks of the 50%, which I'm 
          very thankful for as my game gets buggier by the day and I can get more marks from the write up.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="second">
      <h2>The Portfolio</h2>
      <p>My portfolio is worth the majority of the coursework marks - 28 of the 50%. It consists of four parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Analysis</li>
          <li>Design</li>
          <li>Testing</li>
          <li>Evaluation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="rest">
      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p>This is made up of the background information of my game - the why of its creation. It also describes the user requirements, both 
          functional and non-functional.</p>
      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>My design section includes the initial screen layouts, navigation plan, content plan, final screen layout template, detailed plans, 
          pseudo code and evaluation of my final design. It is mainly reliant upon MS Word's lovely selection of shapes and shades to give 
          it even the slightest hint of professionalism and co-ordination.</p>
      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>This section contains my test plans and evidence, as well as my peer testing and enhancements. It has proven to be by far the most 
          difficult section, as the testing results in bugs being discovered, and attempts to fix the bugs leads to them multiplying and 
          causing even more issues.</p>
      <h3>Evaluation</h3>
      <p>Here I have been writing about my fulfillment of the user requirements from the analysis, and also the strengths, weaknesses and 
          areas of improvement and my personal reflection on my own performance while developing the application. This has been a struggle as 
          a balance must be kept between being self-critical and self-congratulatory.</p>
